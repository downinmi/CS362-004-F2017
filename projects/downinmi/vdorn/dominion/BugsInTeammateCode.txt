The Adventurer card is not correctly moving the cards to the discard pile for most iterations. (There is also a problem with some of the treasure counts, but I had this in my code too, and I believe it to possibly be a problem with shuffle())


   while(z - 1 > 0){   //<-BUG IS HERE  'z - 1 > 0' should be 'z - 1 >= 0'
	// discard all cards in play that have been drawn
	state->discard[currentPlayer][state->discardCount[currentPlayer]++]=temphand[z-1]; 
	z = z - 1;

It looks like the problem with the code is that we are checking z-1 with > 0 instead of = 0. This will cause one card that should be discarded to not be discarded, unless we don’t have any non-treasure cards ahead of our treasure cards in the deck (i.e., there’s nothing to discard)

Council Room Implementation Bug
****************************************************

cardtest3.c:
Card Test 3 -  Council Room
Playing Council Room 500 times...FAILED
Tests:
Current Player Deck Correctly Decreased By Four - FAILED
Current Player Hand Correctly Increased By Three (Four - discard) - FAILED
Other Players' Hands Increased By One - PASSED
Current Player Buys Increased By One  - PASSED
File 'dominion.c'

The implementation of Council Room is failing to handle the card drawing for the player correctly. It is handling the other players drawing and the buys correctly.

Looking at the loop responsible for drawing the card it is clear that the increment counter is incorrectly initialized to 1 instead of 0. 

	for (i = 1; i < 4; i++){  //<-BUG IS HERE    'i = 1' should be 'i = 0'
		drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}
